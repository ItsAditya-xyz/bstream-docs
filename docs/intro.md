# Stream Overview

Filter live on-chain data in second

ðŸ¤– Don't constrain yourself with predefined bots - Create your own and receive messages that matters only

ðŸ˜¡Getting rugged by owners? - Monitor owners wallets and get immediate feedback when they sell tokens or list NFTs

ðŸ’¸Too much money spent on fetching live data to your dApp? - Stream live on-chain data to your dApp using our Websocket integration within minutes

## How does it work?


Bstream extracts every new registered block on the ledger and loads it through our workflows. The data runs through defined filters by the users and executes the integration method for each filter.

Some of the use cases:

- Copy traders: Users can follow trader's wallets activities. Whether it is Swaps, Transfers, Derivative trades. They will be the first to get notified when the trader interacts with the network and act accordingly
- Avoid getting rugged: Users can follow the project owner's wallets and monitor their activity on the token they invested in. They will be the first to know when owners list their NFTs, receive a big amount of the token from the smart contract, or if they start selling the project's tokens. Protect your investments!
- Save time and money on development: Stream data and analytics about your project to your users in three simple steps: Add stream, Filter stream and create a websocket.
